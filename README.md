# Sample Application

The main aim of developing this application is to explore the working of nodejs and expressjs.

## Developing to OpenShift

We use Red Hat's Code Ready Workspaces (CRW) for application development. Pressing on the badge here will set up a workspace for you. 
You don't have to install anything on your workstation. CRW provides IDE and Runtimes!!

To start your workstation in Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces:
